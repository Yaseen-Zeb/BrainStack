# What is a Program
A program itself is a passive entity: it is just a set of instructions stored in secondary memory (for example, a file on disk).
A single program can give rise to multiple processes.
For instance/example, a web browser program can have multiple tabs, and each tab may run as a separate process.





# What is a Proccess
A process itself is a passive entity: The term process (Job) refers to program code that has been loaded into a computer's memory so that it can be executed by the central processing unit (CPU).
Every process has a certain collection of data associated with it. For instance, the name of its parents, the location of the memory space that has been allotted, and security attributes like ownership rights and credentials.
