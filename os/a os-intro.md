# Introduction
An operating system, commonly known as OS, is an essential software program that manages all the hardware and software resources of a computer system. It acts as an intermediary between the computer hardware and the **applications software**.





# Why do we need an operating system?
Before we dive into why we need an operating system, letâ€™s first understand the types of software
## System software
System software is the core set of programs that manage and control computer hardware. It provides a platform for running application software.
Examples include Windows, Linux, and macOS etc.
## Application software
Application software is designed to help users to perform specific tasks or solve particular problems.
It runs on top of the **system software i.e Windows, Linux, macOS**.
Common examples include MS Word, web browsers (like Chrome), games, and mobile apps.
**Now**
Letâ€™s understand this with an example:
Imagine you want to run YouTube on a small computer that only contains CPU, memory, GPU, and disk resources, but no operating system.
Without an operating system, you would first need to write programs to directly interact with these hardware resources such as:
- how to store and retrieve data in memory,
- how to process tasks using the CPU,
- how to handle graphics using the GPU,
- how to manage disk operations.
Once youâ€™ve done all that just to get YouTube running, suppose you now want to run another application, say Notepad, You would need to repeat the same low-level work again.
Moreover, since both applications are running at the same time, you would also have to manually manage:
- how memory is shared,
- how CPU time is divided,
- how input/output (I/O) devices are accessed without conflicts.
This would be extremely complex and time-consuming.
**The Role of the Operating System** is to avoid this headache, an operating system (OS) takes care of all these underlying tasks for you:
It manages hardware resources like CPU, memory, storage, and input/output devices.
It provides common services (like file management, networking, and process scheduling) that applications can use.
Because of the OS, developers only need to focus on writing application-specific code, rather than dealing with the intricate details of hardware management.
**In short**
The operating system acts as a bridge between the hardware and the userâ€™s applications, making development easier and more efficient.





# What is an Operating System?
An Operating System is a piece of software that manages all the resources of a computer system, both hardware and software provide an environment in which the user can execute his/her programs in a convenient(Ø¢Ø³Ø§Ù†) and efficient manner by hiding the underlying complexity of the hardware and acting as a resource manager.
## Operating system goals
There are two main goals of an Operating System:
### Convenience:
The primary goal of OS is to make computer systems easier for users i.e OS makes the interaction between the user and hardware.
### Efficiency:
The secondary goal of OS is to allocate the system resources to various application programs as efficiently as possible.

# Operating System Functions / Responsibilities
Following are some of the important functions of an Operating System
- Process Management
- Memory Management
- File System Management
- Device (I/O) Management
- Storage Management
- Security and Protection
- User Interface / Command Interpretation
- Networking
- Error Detection and Handling
- Resource Allocation
- System Performance Monitoring
- Accounting / Auditing
- Utility Services
