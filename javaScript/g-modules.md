# Why modules exist (the problem they solve)
## How JavaScript Used To Handle Multiple Files (Before ES6 Modules)
Before ES6 modules, there were several problems developers faced when trying to organize and reuse code across multiple files:
Imagine you are building a shopping website.
Your project looks like this:

project/
├── index.html
├── math.js
├── auth.js
├── cart.js
└── main.js

```javaScript
// math.js
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
```
```javaScript
// auth.js
function login() {
    console.log(`Login attempt`);
}
```
```javaScript
// cart.js
function addToCart(product) {
    console.log(`Added ${product} to cart`);
}
```
<!-- Now in HTML: -->
```html
<script src="math.js"></script>
<script src="auth.js"></script>
<script src="cart.js"></script>
<script src="main.js"></script>
```

Everything loads.
Seems fine...
Until...

## The Problems in classic script approach:
All scripts execute in the **global scope**. This means:
- **Global Scope Pollution**: Any variable or function you declare in any JS file is added to the global object (`window` in browsers).
- **Naming Collisions**: Different scripts might use the same variable names. The last script loaded wins, overwriting previous one. This leads to unpredictable behavior and bugs that are hard to track down in large projects. like
 ```javascript
// let say auth.js need the add function

// There are two ways:

// 1. use the math.js add function
add(1, 2); // the problem is: where did add() come from? No idea. You have to search every JavaScript file.

// 2. Creating new add function
function add(a, b) { return a + b; } // the problem is: you are re-declaring a function that already exists. and if there is another file that uses the same function name, it will be overwritten. you never know which one will be used. This can lead to unpredictable behavior and bugs that are hard to track down in large projects.
```
- **Load Order Matters**: You must load files in the correct order. If you load `cart.js` before `math.js`, `cart.js` will not have access to the `add()` function, and your application will break. This can be a nightmare to manage in large projects with many files.
- and lots if others problems as well

## The Solution: Modules
Modules say, Every file is private by default instead of everything being globally accessible.
Instead of:
Globallly Everything accessible
We now have:
math.js with Private add() and subtract()
cart.js with Private checkout()
main.js with Private checkout()
In short Files (Variables, Functions, Classes, etc) are private by default instead of everything being globally accessible.

### How to access things from other files
We use **Export** and **Import** keywords.
This creates a clear contract:
math.js
   │
   │ exports
   ▼
main.js
   │
   │ imports
   ▼
Uses add()

#### Two ways to export and import:
1. **Named exports**: Multiple exports per file.
2. **Default exports**: A module can have at most one default export, but it can also have named exports alongside it.
```javascript
// Named Exports
export function add(a, b) { return a + b; }
export function subtract(a, b) { return a - b; }

// Default Exports
export default function add(a, b) { return a + b; }
```
```javascript
// Named Imports
import { add, subtract } from './math.js';

// Default Imports
import add from './math.js';
```
##### When to use each type
###### Use Named Exports when:
- You have multiple functions, variables, or classes to export from a single file
- You want to be explicit about what you are exporting
- You want to allow importing specific items without importing the entire file
###### Use Default Exports when:
- You have a single main export from a file
- You want to provide a default import option
- You want to allow importing with any name





## What Happens When a File Becomes a Module?
When a JavaScript file is treated as a module, it gains a few special properties:
1. **Private Scope by Default**: Variables, functions, classes, and imports declared in a module are private to that module unless explicitly exported.
2. **No Automatic Global Variables**: Unlike regular scripts, modules do not automatically create global variables.
3. **Module Execution**: When a module is loaded, its code is executed only once, and the results (like exported values) are cached for future imports.

## Example of a Module
Here's how a file works as a module:
```javascript
// math.js - This file is a module
const API_KEY = "123456"; // Private variable - not accessible outside

export function add(a, b) { 
    // Can access API_KEY because it's in the same module
    console.log(`Using API key: ${API_KEY}`); 
    return a + b;
}
```
In this example, `API_KEY` is private to `math.js`. Only `add()` is exported and can be used by other modules.





# How Module and Classic Script work?
## Classic Script
When a classic script is loaded, the browser creates a Global Execution Context.
Global Execution Context
        │
        ▼
Global Environment Record
The Global Environment Record is special because it is divided into two parts.
Global Environment Record
│
├── Object Environment Record
│      │
│      └── window (Global Object)
│
└── Declarative Environment Record
### Object Environment Record
This record is connected to the browser's global object (window).
The browser exposes its global APIs here, such as:
`window`
`document`
`console`
`fetch`
`setTimeout`
`location`
`history`
and many other Browser Object Model (BOM) and Document Object Model (DOM) APIs.
In classic scripts, **global var declarations and function declarations also become properties of the global object.**
Example:
```javascript
var user = "Ali";
function greet() {}
// These are accessible as:
window.user;
window.greet;
```
### Declarative Environment Record
This stores bindings that are not properties of the global object, including:
`let`
`const`
`class`
Example:
```javascript
let age = 20;
const city = "Peshawar";
// These exist in the Global Environment Record but not on `window`.
window.age;   // undefined
window.city;  // undefined
```
### Scope Chain in Classic Script
Scope chaining in classic scripts works by traversing up the lexical environment chain until the global scope is reached.
Function Scope -> Global Environment Record

## Module
When we run js, it similarly creates an execution context.
Global Execution Context
        │
        ▼
Global Environment Record
The Global Environment Record is special because it is divided into two parts.
Global Environment Record
│
├── Object Environment Record
│      │
│      └── window (Global Object)
│
└── Declarative Environment Record

After that When the browser encounters:
```html
<script type="module">
```
it creates a Module Environment Record for that module.
### Module Environment Record
Unlike the Global Environment Record, a Module Environment Record is not divided into an Object Environment Record and a Declarative Environment Record.
It is a single declarative environment that stores the module's bindings.
It contains:
`var`
`let`
`const`
`class`
`function declarations`
`imported bindings`
`exported bindings`
For example:
```javascript
var count = 1;
const name = "Ali";
function greet() {}
```
All of these belong to the module itself.
None become properties of window.
window.count;   // undefined
window.greet;   // undefined
This is one of the biggest differences between classic scripts and ES Modules.
### Accessing Browser APIs
Modules can still access browser APIs.
For example:
console.log(document);
The lookup happens like this:
Function Environment
        ↓
Module Environment Record
        ↓
Global Environment Record
The Module Environment does not contain document, so JavaScript continues searching until it reaches the Global Environment Record, where the browser provides the binding.
This is why document, console, fetch, and setTimeout still work inside modules.
**Note:** if there is only "type="module"" declared on a script file, then our defined variables, functions, classes, etc. will not be added to the window object. It will be added only if we explicitly add them through classical script type.
### Additional Features of Module Environment Records
Besides providing a separate scope, modules introduce several capabilities that classic scripts do not have.
**Export** A module makes specific bindings (variables, functions, classes, etc.) available for use by other modules.
**Import** Other modules can import and use those bindings.
**Live Bindings** This means the imported binding is a live connection, not a copy. If the original value changes, the imported value changes too.
```javascript
// first.js
export let count = 10;
export function increment() {
    count++;
}
// second.js
import { increment } from './first.js'; 
import { logCount } from './main.js'; 
increment();
increment();
increment();
logCount(); // 13
// main.js
import { count } from './first.js';
export function logCount() {
    console.log(count);
}
```
**Module Cache** When the browser loads the same module more than once (like multiple files importing the same module), it doesn't re-run the code. It reuses the already cached version. This makes loading much faster.
```javascript
// first.js
export function load() {
    console.log("Module loaded");
}
// second.js
import { load } from './first.js'; 
load();
load();
load();
// thid.js
import { load } from './first.js'; 
load(); // it uses the cached version
```
**Strict Mode** All code inside a module automatically runs in strict mode. This enforces safer coding practices and eliminates confusing language features.
**Top-Level this** The value of this at the top level of a module is undefined (unlike classic scripts where it's the window object). This prevents accidental global variable creation.





# How Module Scripts Load & Execute?
This process has few stages whicha are as under:
## Discover Entry Modules and Load Them and Build Module Dependency Graph
```html
<script type="module" src="./server.js"></script>
<script type="module" src="./auth.js"></script>
<script type="module" src="./user.js"></script>
```
At this point, no JavaScript has executed. The browser identifies the entry modules (root modules), downloads them, recursively follows their import statements, downloads any missing modules, and builds the complete module dependency graph.
For example:
```javascript
// server.js
import { auth } from './auth.js';
// auth.js
import { user } from './user.js';
export const auth = true;
// user.js
export const user = true;
```
In this case, the module graph would look like this:
server.js
        ↓
    auth.js
         ↓
     user.js
This means server.js depends on auth.js, which depends on user.js.
After building the module graph, the browser can execute the modules in the correct order.

## Module Instantiation (Linking)
Module Instantiation concept is a little bit confusing, i would suggest you to watch video of code king on this topic, but i will try to explain it here:
For now assume that in this just like hoisting happens in classic script, same for modules also, the browser creates an environment record and hoists all the import and export statements of all scripts found in module dependency graph. let's say there is a file that export below things so as according to hoisting variables will be accessible to another files as below without executing the code of that file:
var = undefined
regular function = function declaration
class = `<uninitialized>` Temporal Dead Zone
let = `<uninitialized>` Temporal Dead Zone
const = `<uninitialized>` Temporal Dead Zone
now the autual values to variables/functions will be assigned at the time of execution. (Same as Memory and Call Stack explanation)

## Execute Modules
Once the module dependency graph has been built and all modules have been linked, the browser starts executing the modules.
Execution begins from the entry module(s). If a module depends on another module that has not yet been executed, the browser pauses the current module, executes the dependency first, and then resumes execution of the paused module.
Each module is executed only once. If another module imports a module that has already started or finished executing, the browser reuses the existing Module Record instead of executing the module again.
Then execution unwinds back up the chain.
**Now** here the most important concept to understand is that every module has flags (evaluated/not evaluated and known/unknown) and many more but these two are importat in below explanation.
Once the browser loads a module, it creates a Module Record and caches it. After the module successfully executes, its state becomes 'evaluated'. Future imports reuse the same Module Record; the module is never executed again.

### Scenario 1: Multiple files import the same module
      app.js
      /   \
     /     \
 user.js  admin.js
      \    /
       \  /
      utils.js
#### What happens?
- Browser loads all modules.
- Creates one Module Record for utils.js.
- Executes utils.js once.
- Both user.js and admin.js receive the same exported bindings.

### Scenario 2: Two files import each other
This is also know as **cyclic dependency**
For Example:
main.js
   ▲
   │
   ▼
math.js
#### What happens?
- Browser loads both files.
- Creates Module Records for both.
- Starts executing main.js.
- main.js imports math.js, so it pauses.
- Starts executing math.js.
- math.js imports main.js.
- The browser checks:
    - Is main.js known?
        ✓ Yes.
    - Is main.js already being evaluated?
        ✓ Yes.
- Therefore:
    - ❌ Do NOT execute main.js again.
    - Reuse the existing Module Record.
    - Continue executing math.js.


#### Cyclic Dependency Issue
This issue may arise when two modules import each other:
For example:
```javascript
// first.js
import { second } from './second.js';
export const first = 10;
console.log({second});
// second.js
import { first } from './first.js';
export const second = 20;
console.log({first}); // Error : Cannot access 'first' before initialization
```
In this case, 
-when the browser executes first.js, it encounters an import statement for second.js. It pauses the execution of first.js and starts executing second.js. Then, second.js encounters an import statement for first.js. The browser checks:
Is first.js known?
✓ Yes.
Is first.js already being evaluated?
✓ Yes.
Therefore:
❌ Do NOT execute first.js again.
Reuse the existing Module Record.
Continue executing second.js.
Now as second.js reach to this line `console.log({first})` and error is thrown.

##### How to Fix It
###### Solution 1: Use Functions (Hoisting to the Rescue)
```javascript
// first.js
import { second } from './second.js';
function getFirst() {
    return 10;
}
console.log({second});
export { getFirst };
// second.js
import { getFirst } from './first.js';
function getSecond() {
    return 20;
}
console.log({ first: getFirst() }); // { first: 10 }
export { getSecond };
```
Explanation: 
Because functions are hoisted as we discussed in in **Instatiation** phase of module execution, they are available immediately. When second.js tries to access getFirst(), the function declaration has already been processed,so even though the module's execution hasn't reached that point yet it is available.

###### Solution 2: Break the Cycle (The Best Practice)
The most robust architectural fix is to ensure modules don't depend on each other symmetrically. If first.js needs second.js and second.js needs first.js, they usually share a common dependency. You can extract the shared logic or variables into a third file.
```javascript
// utils.js
export const first = 30;
export const second = 40;
// first.js
import { second } from './utils.js';
console.log({ second });
// second.js
import { first } from './utils.js';
console.log({first});
```





# Dynamic import()
Dynamic import() is a feature in JavaScript that allows you to import modules on demand, rather than all at once when the page loads. It returns a Promise that resolves to the module object.
## Syntax
```javascript
// Syntax: 
import('module-name').then(module => {
    // Use the module
}).catch(error => {
    // Handle errors
});
// or
const module = await import('module-name');
```
**Note**: Dynamic import returns a Promise, not the module itself. You need to use .then() or await to access the module.
## Example
```javascript
// math.js
export function sum(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

// main.js
button.addEventListener("click", async () => {
   const math = await import('./math.js');
   math.sum(1,2);
});
```





# ES Modules vs CommonJS
Many developers think: "CommonJS and ES Modules are just two different syntaxes."
That is not true.
They represent two completely different module systems, created at different times for different environments.
## Differences:
### Loading:
**ES Modules**
load files before executing the code or if dynamic import is used then load files during the execution of code(asynchronously).
**CommonJS**
load files during the execution of code(synchronously)
**Example:**
```javascript
console.log("Start");

const math = require("./math");

console.log("End");

// Es Module:
// before evaluating the code do the import/export and load all the files.
// and after that execute the code

// CommonJS
// load the files during the execution of code(synchronously)
```

# Bundlers
A bundler is a tool that analyzes your application's module dependency graph and combines (or processes) your source files into optimized files that browsers can efficiently load.
## Popular bundlers include:
- Webpack
- Vite (uses Rollup for production builds)
- Rollup
- Parcel
- esbuild
- Rspack

## Why Do We Need a Bundler?
Suppose your project looks like this:
src/
│
├── main.js
├── auth.js
├── user.js
├── api.js
├── utils.js
├── validation.js
├── dashboard.js
├── profile.js
└── ...
Every file imports another file.
main.js
   │
   ▼
auth.js
   │
   ▼
user.js
   │
   ▼
utils.js
Without a bundler:
- Browser downloads many JavaScript files.
- Browser builds the module graph.
- Browser executes modules.
Modern browsers support this just fine.

## Then Why Use a Bundler?
Because bundlers do much more than just combine files.

### Bundle Modules
Bundlers combine multiple modules into one (or a few) files.
This reduces the number of HTTP requests, improving load time.

### Build the Dependency Graph and Tree Shaking
Just like the browser, bundlers analyze the import/export relationships between modules to create a complete dependency graph. During this process, they can identify and remove unused code (dead code elimination) through a technique called **tree shaking**, ensuring that only the code actually used in the application is included in the final bundle.
Suppose
```javascript
// math.js
export function add() {}
export function subtract() {}
export function multiply() {}
export function divide() {}


// main.js and you only use add() function
import { add } from "./math.js";

// The other functions are not included in the final bundle.
// This is called Tree Shaking.
```

### Optimize Code (Minification)
Bundlers can minify code (remove whitespace and comments and also change variable names to shorter ones etc) and optimize it for better performance.
```javascript
// Before minification
const sum = (a, b) => {
    return a + b;
};
const difference = (a, b) => {
    return a - b;
};
const product = (a, b) => {
    return a * b;
};
const quotient = (a, b) => {
    return a / b;
};

// After minification
const s = (a, b) => {
    return a + b;
};
const d = (a, b) => {
    return a - b;
};
const p = (a, b) => {
    return a * b;
};
const q = (a, b) => {
    return a / b;
};
```

### Code Splitting (Lazy Loading / Dynamic Import)
Code splitting is a technique that allows you to split your code into smaller chunks that can be loaded on demand. This improves the initial load time of your application.
Instead of one huge bundle
bundle.js (all files combined)

The bundler can produce
main.js
dashboard.chunk.js
admin.chunk.js
The browser downloads
main.js only on route /
import("./dashboard.js") will download dashboard.chunk.js only on route /dashboard 
import("./admin.js") will download admin.chunk.js only on route /admin

### Asset Handling
Bundlers can handle assets like CSS, images, fonts, etc which vanilla browsers can't directly import.
```javascript
// Import CSS
import "./style.css";

// Import images
import logo from "./logo.png";

// etc
```
The browser cannot natively process everything this way, but bundlers can.

### TypeScript Support
Modern bundlers have built-in TypeScript support. They use the TypeScript compiler to check for type errors and can transpile TypeScript code to JavaScript before bundling.
```javascript
// You can write
const age: number = 20;
// The bundler (or an associated compiler) converts it into JavaScript.
```

### JSX Support
Bundlers have built-in JSX support. They use the TypeScript compiler to check for type errors and can transpile TypeScript code to JavaScript before bundling.
```javascript
// React component in JSX
const MyComponent = () => {
    return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
};
// becomes plain JavaScript before reaching the browser or before bundling.
```

### Development Server
Bundlers provide a development server that serves your application following additional features:
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) (without reload we can see the changes, very helpful in state management)
- Live Reload (reload the page on code change)
- Fast builds (help in faster development)
- Error overlays (show error in the form of overlay during development)

## How a Bundler Works
Suppose
- main.js
- imports
- auth.js
- which imports
- user.js
The bundler does:
Step 1:
- Read entry file
    - main.js
Step 2:
- Follow every import
    main
     ↓
    auth
     ↓
    user
Step 3:
- Build dependency graph
Step 4:
- Optimize
    - Tree shaking
    - Minification
    - Code splitting
    - Asset optimization
Step 5:
- Generate production files:
    - dist/
        - main.js
        - vendor.js
        - style.css
        - assets/

## Browser vs Bundler
| Browser                        | Bundler                            |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Loads modules at runtime       | Analyzes modules before deployment |
| Builds module graph            | Builds module graph                |
| Executes ES modules            | Produces optimized build output    |
| Doesn't remove unused code     | Performs tree shaking              |
| Doesn't minify                 | Minifies code                      |
| Doesn't optimize assets        | Optimizes assets                   |
| Doesn't compile TypeScript/JSX | Compiles/transforms them           |
