# Node.js Architecture

## Main Thread
The main thread in Node.js is where all JavaScript code executes (via the call stack) and where the event loop runs.
**Synchronous tasks** run directly on the **call stack**, which executes them line by line.
**Asynchronous tasks** are delegated by the main thread to the **OS kernel or the libuv thread pool**, preventing blocking of execution.
The **event loop** manages asynchronous callbacks by pulling them from queues and pushing them into the call stack once it is free.

## OS Kernel
The OS kernel is the operating systemâ€™s core that directly manages hardware resources (CPU, memory, disk, network).
Asynchronous tasks that can be handled directly by the OS kernel are assign to OS kernel by the Main Thread.
### What Uses the OS Kernel?
Network I/O 
â€¢ HTTP
â€¢ TCP
â€¢ UDP
â€¢ sockets
is usually handled by the OS kernel, since most operating systems natively provide efficient non-blocking APIs for these.

## Thread Pool
The Thread Pool is a group of background worker threads managed by **libuv (the C library under Node.js)**.
By default, it has **4 threads** (can be increased via UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE).
Asynchronous tasks that cannot be handled directly by the OS kernel are assign to Thread Pool by the Main Thread.
### What Uses the Thread Pool?
Not everything async in Node.js uses the thread pool.
The thread pool is used for tasks that cannot be handled directly by the OS kernel:
â€¢ File system operations (fs.readFile, fs.writeFile)
â€¢ Crypto operations (crypto.pbkdf2, crypto.scrypt, hashing, encryption)
â€¢ Compression (zlib)
â€¢ DNS lookups (dns.lookup)

## Note:-
When an asynchronous task is assigned (like file read/write, timers, or network calls), it has two parts:
â€¢ The asynchronous operation itself â†’ handled outside the main thread (by the OS, the libuv thread pool, or kernel).
â€¢ The callback (synchronous JS code) â†’ once the operation finishes, the callback is placed into the event loop queue, and then executed on the main threadâ€™s call stack.
**So**
Async work (waiting, reading, writing, networking) â†’ done in the background by the assignee (OS, the libuv thread pool, or kernel).
Sync work (your callback code logic) â†’ always runs on the main threadâ€™s call stack.
