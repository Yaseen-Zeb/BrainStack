# Node.js Architecture

## Main Thread
The main thread in Node.js is where all JavaScript code executes (via the call stack) and where the event loop runs.
**Synchronous tasks** run directly on the **call stack**, which executes them line by line.
**Asynchronous tasks** are delegated by the main thread to the **OS kernel or the libuv thread pool**, preventing blocking of execution.
The **event loop** manages asynchronous callbacks by pulling them from queues and pushing them into the call stack once it is free.
