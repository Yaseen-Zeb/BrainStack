# Node.js Architecture

## Main Thread
The main thread in Node.js is where all JavaScript code executes (via the call stack) and where the event loop runs.
**Synchronous tasks** run directly on the **call stack**, which executes them line by line.
**Asynchronous tasks** are delegated by the main thread to the **OS kernel or the libuv thread pool**, preventing blocking of execution.
The **event loop** manages asynchronous callbacks by pulling them from queues and pushing them into the call stack once it is free.

## OS Kernel
The OS kernel is the operating systemâ€™s core that directly manages hardware resources (CPU, memory, disk, network).
Asynchronous tasks that can be handled directly by the OS kernel are assign to OS kernel by the Main Thread.
### What Uses the OS Kernel?
Network I/O 
â€¢ HTTP
â€¢ TCP
â€¢ UDP
â€¢ sockets
is usually handled by the OS kernel, since most operating systems natively provide efficient non-blocking APIs for these.

## Thread Pool
The Thread Pool is a group of background worker threads managed by **libuv (the C library under Node.js)**.
By default, it has **4 threads** (can be increased via UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE).
Asynchronous tasks that cannot be handled directly by the OS kernel are assign to Thread Pool by the Main Thread.
### What Uses the Thread Pool?
Not everything async in Node.js uses the thread pool.
The thread pool is used for tasks that cannot be handled directly by the OS kernel:
â€¢ File system operations (fs.readFile, fs.writeFile)
â€¢ Crypto operations (crypto.pbkdf2, crypto.scrypt, hashing, encryption)
â€¢ Compression (zlib)
â€¢ DNS lookups (dns.lookup)
