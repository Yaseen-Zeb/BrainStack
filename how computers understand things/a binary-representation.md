# Intro
In every era, humans need to send messages to each others.
- They began with signs, drawings, and writing which is simple but slow.
- Then came smoke signals, drums, and letters but still limited by distance.
- Later, the mechanical age began â€” with printing presses, typewriters, and early calculators helping us share and process information faster but requiring a lot of effort and energy.
- Than electricity invented and slowly communication met electricity. Today, everything you see on a screen â€” text, sound, photos, and games â€” works using just two states: on and off.





# Why computers use binary (0 and 1)
Here very interesting thing come. Before solving any problem, we first identify what we need to achieve and what possibilities are available.
Similarly:
- Computers run on electricity, and electricity has only two possible states ON or OFF.
- To represent these two states, we use 1 for ON and 0 for OFF.
- Now to comunicate with electricity we need to encoded and decode our language to 0 & 1
