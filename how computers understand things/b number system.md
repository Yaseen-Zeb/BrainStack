# What is a Number System
A number system is a way of representing **quantities** using symbols or digits.
Every number system has:
- A base (i.e 2, 10, 8, 16)
- A set of symbols i.e (for bi:0,1), (for di 0-9), (for oct 0-7) etc
- Rules for how those symbols are used





# Why different number systems exist
**System**	 **Purpose**
Binary	     (1 = ON, 0 = OFF) is the actual hardware states.
Hexadecimal	 A way to represent large binary numbers shortly (e.g 1111 1111 0000 1010 = Hex FF0A).
Decimal	     For human input/output (easy to read).
Octal	     Used in **early** computers to make binary numbers shorter by grouping bits in 3s (e.g., 111 = 7).
