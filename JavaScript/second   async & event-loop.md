1. **Web APIs**
2. **Microtasks vs Macrotasks**





# Web APIs
Web APIs are built into the browser, not JavaScript itself.
They let JS interact with the browser and external systems.
JS (single-threaded) uses these APIs to handle tasks asynchronously without blocking the main thread.
OR
These are features provided by the browser environment‚Äînot by the JS language itself. They do work ‚Äúon the side‚Äù and notify JS when they‚Äôre done.

## Common Web APIs
Timers: setTimeout, setInterval
Network: fetch, XMLHttpRequest
DOM Events: clicks, keypress, scroll, etc.
Others: Geolocation, Notifications, Web Workers, IntersectionObserver, etc.

## Flow
You call a Web API ‚Üí the browser starts the task ‚Üí when it‚Äôs ready, it enqueues a callback to be run by the JS event loop.

Note: In Node.js there‚Äôs no ‚Äúbrowser,‚Äù but a similar system exists (libuv). Concepts still map.





# Microtasks vs Macrotasks
When the browser has a callback ready, it doesn‚Äôt throw it straight onto the call stack. It first puts it into one of two queues:
**Microtask Queue** (high priority)
Stores callbacks from Promises (.then, .catch, .finally), queueMicrotask, await, MutationObserver, and process.nextTick (Node.js).
The event loop execute this queue completely before moving on to the next macrotask.
**Macrotask Queue** (normal priority)
Stores callbacks from setTimeout, setInterval, setImmediate (Node.js), DOM events, I/O operations, network callbacks.
The event loop picks one macrotask per tick, then execute all microtasks before rendering.
