# What is npm?
npm = Node Package Manager
It is:
- a package manager for JavaScript
- comes automatically with Node.js
- used to install, update, remove, and manage packages





# Why do we need npm?
## Without npm:
- You would manually download JS libraries
- Copy files into your project
- Manage versions yourself
## With npm:
- One command installs libraries
- Version control is automatic
- Dependency management is easy





# What is a package?
## A package is:
- a reusable piece of code
- written by someone else (or you)
- published on npm registry
## Examples:
- express → web server
- mongoose → MongoDB
- react → UI library
- nodemon → auto restart server
